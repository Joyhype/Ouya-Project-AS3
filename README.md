Project02_Ouya
==============

This is a AS3 project that uses Starling and runs on Ouya / Android TV devices. 

You'll need to dig through some of the code / setup classes and edit them to your liking. From there you can push a APK via Terminal/Command Line into the ADB command lines and it should run on OUYA.
